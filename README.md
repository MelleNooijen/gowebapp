# Go Webapp
This is my first experiment in Go. I have gone into this small project with no prior experience, therefore the quality of code might be quite low.
## What does this do?
Not much. It provides a very barebones HTTP server for rendering templates and serving static files (and handling errors).
I might work on this in the future and expand it into something more, however this repository only serves the purpose of showing off my first Go project and is not intended to be a fully functional program.
